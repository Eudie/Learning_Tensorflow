# This is guide to install Tensorflow GPU version on Ubuntu16.04

------------------------
Dual boot with ubuntu
------------------------
If your laptop has inbuilt Nvidia GPU, then you might face problem booting(ASUS:GL552VW)
In that user has to go to edit from installation window
Then add " nouveau.modeset=0 acpi_osi=! acpi_backlight=native idle=nomwait" in the line starts with "linux"(take care of wrap text). 

[
The Nouveau command disables the NVidia card, which you need to do until you get proper drivers installed.

The ACPI commands make your keyboard hotkeys work properly

The idle command is needed to make the new Skylake chipset speed up and down properly without locking up.
